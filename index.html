  <h1>Fireworks</h1>
  <p>In this project, our goal is to explore the principles and dynamic applications of Object-Oriented Programming by creating a Particle World. We aim to visualize and simulate real-world shapes, patterns, and movements in a creative manner. To achieve this, we'll define a self-contained class with properties and methods, apply various motions, utilize interactions, and incorporate at least two additional methods to govern the behavior of the particles.In the visualization, I was inspired to create a firework as every time when there is New Years eve, I would not want to its the immersive fireworks in the sky as fireworks was used to be one of my fears since it has a loud voice.</p>
